# Homestuck Desktop Buddies v1.0.0
Desktop Companion featuring the Homestuck Kids

The Homestuck Kids, now on your desktop! Watch them hang around while you try to work, study, or do anything remotely productive! Don't let them distract you too much! ~~The program also notifies you whenever Homestuck^2 updates, connecting to Homestuck^2 RSS feed every 30 seconds.~~ No more update checking, since Homestuck^2 won't have a regular update schedule anymore.

Supports multi monitor setups (in theory, at least it works on mine).

Currently only John, Rose, Dave and Jade are available~~, but I plan on also adding Alpha kids~~.

Things I plan on adding eventually:

* ~~All the kids, Beta and Alpha.~~
* ~~Different clothes for each kid (like God Tier outfits) and change the animations depending on the current outfit.~~
* ~~Option to select active monitor in case of a multi monitor setup.~~
* ~~Option to disable checking for Homestuck^2 updates.~~ It no longer checks for updates, so there's that.
* ~~An actual about page.~~

This project is pretty much done, maybe I'll update it if it needs bugfixes or something. It was fun to do, but I have other stuff to work on now. It's still kind of sad that the last update removes features instead of adding them, though.
